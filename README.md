# Debates on a Burden: Exploring the Connotations of the Wehrmacht in Post-War German Politics

## Abstract

This paper investigates the evolving connotations of the Wehrmacht in post-war German politics. By analyzing term frequencies and comparing diachronic word embeddings on a corpus of German parliamentary debates, we measure prevalence and context of references to the Wehrmacht over time. The results show that the Wehrmacht went from being a prominent issue of defense and welfare policies to near irrelevance by the 1960s. They also indicate that the resurgent post-reunification controversies on the Wehrmachtâ€™s war crimes did not mark a shift in political culture, but followed a subtle, decades-long trend of increasingly strong associations between the Wehrmacht, war crimes, and Nazism in political speech. Based on this example, we also discuss the relevance of word embeddings in studying and visualizing historical discourses.
