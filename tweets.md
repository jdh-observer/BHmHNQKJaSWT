1. How have German politicians dealt with the burdensome legacy of militarism after the Second World War? This paper explores the connotations of the Wehrmacht in political speech through word embeddings trained on parliamentary proceedings.

2. The Bundestag - (West) Germanyâ€™s federal legislature - has published its proceedings since 1949. Digitized editions of these proceedings contain over 900,000 speeches, questions, and interjections, forming a valuable but underutilized corpus of sources on post-war German politics.

3. To assess the semantic changes in how German politicians spoke about the Wehrmacht, we use overlapping diachronic word embeddings. An additional analysis of term frequency measures the level of interest in the Wehrmacht over time.

4. German politicians spoke most frequently about the Wehrmacht in the 1950s, with a noticeable resurgence of interest following German reunification in the 1990s. During this period, the Wehrmacht shifted from being relevant to social and defense policies to becoming integrated into a culture of remembrance.

5. The paper illustrates how the combination of frequency analysis and diachronic word embeddings can help to explore and understand the development of long-running discourses in large sets of historical data.
